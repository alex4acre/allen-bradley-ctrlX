# README datalayer.register.node

The sample app __datalayer.register.node__ creates a new provider with node '__myData__' and different type elements to the ctrlX Data Layer.

## Introduction

It demonstrates how you can create a node with data elements to ctrlX CORE or ctrlx CORE Virtual Data Layer. These elements can be accessed by a client app (e.g. sample app datalayer.client)

* a data provider -> registernode (snap name)
* a data client -> datalayerclient (snap name) can be used to change the values of provided nodes of datalayer.register.node

## Pre-requisites

* Buildenvironment WSL or Virtual Box
* ctrlX AUTOMATION SDK Version 1.2 
* ctrlX CORE<sup>virtual</sup> or ctrlX CORE


## Getting Started

1. Launch IDE (VSCode for example)
2. Open the sample directory `samples-cpp/datalayer.register.node`
3. Build and install the snap as described [build](./../build.md)
4. Check output in the web interface

## Troubleshooting

All automatically created files are located in folders `build` and `generated`.  
If there are unclear messages during the build process, it might help to delete the folders `build` and `generated` and restart the build process.
